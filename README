Pick A Winner NFL Football Application
--------------------------------------

Created by: Mark Vance

Pool style NFL application written in Ruby on Rails - Mostly just for the fun of learning Rails

League is setup at the beginning of the football season.  Each player joins league and decides
how many picks they would like.  Before each week of football, the player must pick a team to
win that particular week.  If their team wins, then they get to keep their pick.  Otherwise,
the pick is lost.  If that is the players last pick, the player is eliminated.  Game is over
when the there is one person left.  If more than one player is left and all players are 
eliminated the same week, players tie.

Variations of the game can exist:

Traditionally, a player can only pick a team once a week.  Therefore, if a player has multiple 
picks, they must pick different teams for each pick of that week.

Some leagues don't allow players to "re-pick" a team more than once during the season.  This
adds much more strategy and planning ahead to having to pick underdogs late in the season.

"Re-pick" can be prohibited late in the season if players are not being eliminated fast enough.
